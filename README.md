# Dimension-Reduction-MATLAB-code.
This repository provides MATLAB code for PSO-based dimensionality reduction that projects 3D HQAM constellation points into 2D while preserving the MED. The PSO optimizes a 6-variable vector for the 3×2 projection matrix, and multiple runs may be needed to reach the target MED.
